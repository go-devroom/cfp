# Go Devroom CfP — FOSDEM 2023

Hi gophers,

The Go community has been represented at FOSDEM every year since 2014. The year 2023 won't be any different

This year again the Go devroom will be **in-person again** in Brussels on Saturday February 4th 2022 and we are now looking for speakers. The format will be 25 minutes talk with 5 minutes for Q&A at the end.

This is a great opportunity for new speakers, and we will have people helping you craft your talk and slides if so you wish. So if you, or someone you know, are working on something cool that might be good on stage, submit a proposal!

Do you want to be one of our speakers? Please submit your proposal using [pentabarf](https://penta.fosdem.org/event/new). The deadline for submission is Decemnber 10th 2022 (23:59 UTC).
Should you need any help using pentabarf check out our [“Guide to Pentabarf”](https://eyskens.me/beginners-guide-to-pentabarf/).
If you want us to check whether your proposal came through correctly, you can always contact us at [go-devroom-manager@fosdem.org](mailto:go-devroom-manager@fosdem.org).

Do you want to help organize the devroom? We need people to help on the day itself (doors, microphone handover, camera, allaround). Bur we are also especially looking for many people to help with reviewing the proposals and help with mentoring.
Please send us an email to [go-devroom-manager@fosdem.org](mailto:go-devroom-manager@fosdem.org) if you’d like to help out with this.

Any topics related to Go are welcome, with a preference for open source projects rather than product pitches. We value talks about how a given project uses Go rather than how a project written in Go is used.

The room will follow Go’s [Code of Conduct](https://golang.org/conduct).

Cheers,  
Maartje Eyskens
